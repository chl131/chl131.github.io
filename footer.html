                        <b>Dear visitor, </b><br>
                        Today is going to be an amazing day, and here's why: <br>
                        You are now on an awesome website with a bunch of cool stuff. <br>
                        Perhaps you're here because you clicked the link on my LinkedIn, <br>
                        and you wanna know more about my work. <br>
                        Maybe you are an audiophile or a melophile like me, <br>
                        so, you are interested in those stereo system and music blogs. <br>
                        Or, you know nothing about me before today. <br>
                        For some random reason, you got on my website, <br>
                        and those journeys of gourmet hunting caught your eyes, <br>
                        therefore, you ended up reading all the way down to this spot. <br>
                        In any case, I am glad that you met me at this place, at this moment. <br>
                        Hope you learning about my projects and posts. <br>
                        If any part of this place can bring you a different prospect of view, <br>
                        a new type of taste, or even a good mood, I will be more than happy about it. <br>
                        <br>
                        Thank you!
                    </p>
